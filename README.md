# ComputationalMethods
R Code for various computational methods in Finance

This module will contain code to:
  1. Price put and call options using Black-Scholes model
  2. Download equity option data for given maturity dates and save them as .csv files
  3. Load up option data from a .csv file and generate a volatility smile and curve based on the Black-Scholes model
  4. Price call options using the Heston volatility model
  
A report of the code and the findings of this exercise can be generated by running "./generateHW1.sh BSImpliedVolHeston". This command will invoke a script that will knit up a .Rmd file into a latex .pdf file
