# Computational Methods
R Code for various computational methods in Finance
### Module 1: Black-Scholes, Implied Vol, Quardrature methods and Heston Calibration
  1. Price put and call options using Black-Scholes model
  3. Download equity option data for given maturity dates and save them as .csv files
  5. Load up option data from a .csv file and generate a volatility smile and curve based on the Black-Scholes model
  7. Price call options using the Heston volatility model
  2. We also explore various quardrature methods inclding Simpson's and Trapezoid method

  A report of the code and the findings of this exercise can be generated by running "./generateHW1.sh BSImpliedVolHeston". This command will invoke a script that will knit up a .Rmd file into a latex .pdf file
